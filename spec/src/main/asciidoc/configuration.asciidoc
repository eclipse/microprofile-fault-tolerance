== Fault Tolerance configuration

This specification defines the programming model to build a resilient microservice.
Microservices developed using this feature are guaranteed to be resilient despite of running environments.
In some service mash platform, e.g. Istio, has its own Fault Tolerance policy.
The operation team might want to use the platform Fault Tolerance.
In order to fulfil the requirement, MicroProfile Fault Tolerance provides a capability to have its resilient functionalities except `fallback` disabled.
The reason `fallback` is special as the `fallback` business logic can only be defined by microservices not by any other platforms.

Set the config property of `MP_Fault_Tolerance_NonFallback_Enabled` with the value of `false` means the Fault Tolerance is disabled, except `@Fallback`.
If the property is absent or with the value of `true`, it means that MicroProfile Fault Tolerance is enabled if any annotations are specified.  For more information about how to set config properties, refer to MicroProfile Config specification.

In order to prevent from any unexpected behaviours, the property `MP_Fault_Tolerance_NonFallback_Enabled` will only be read on application starting.
Any dynamic changes afterwards will be ignored until  the application restarting.

=== Config Fault Tolerance parameters

This specification defines the annotations: `@Asynchronous`, `@Bulkhead`, `@CircuitBreaker`, `@Fallback`, `@Retry` and `@Timeout`.
Each annotation except `@Asynchronous` has parameters.
All of the parameters are configurable.
The value of each parameter can be overridden individually or globally.

* Override individual parameters
The annotation parameters can be overwritten via config properties in the naming convention of `<classname>/<methodname>/<annotation>/<parameter>`.

The `<classname>` and `<methodname>` must be the class name and method name where the annotation is declared upon.

In the following code snippet, in order to override the `maxRetries` for serviceB invocation to 100, set the config property `com.acme.test.MyClient/serviceB/Retry/maxRetries=100`
Similarly to override the `maxDuration` for ServiceA, set the config property

`com.acme.test.MyClient/serviceA/Retry/maxDuration=3000`

* Override parameters globally

If the parameters for a particular annotation need to be configured with the same value for a particular class, use the config property `<classname>/<annotation>/<parameter>` for configuration.
For an instance, use the following config property to override all `maxRetries` for `Retry` specified on the class `MyClient` to 100.

`com.acme.test.MyClient/Retry/maxRetries=100`

Sometimes, the parameters need to be configured with the same value for the whole microservice.
For an instance, all `Timeout` needs to be set to `100ms`.
It can be cumbersome to override each occurrence of `Timeout`.
In this circumstance, the config property `<annotation>/<parameter>` overrides the corresponding parameter value for the specified annotation.
For instance, in order to override the `maxRetries` for the `Retry` to be `30`, specify the config property `Retry/maxRetries=30`.

When multiple config properties are present, the property `<classname>/<methodname>/<annotation>/<parameter>` takes precedence over `<classname>/<annotation>/<parameter>`, which is followed by `<annotation>/<parameter>`.

The override just changes the value of the corresponding parameter specified in the microservice and nothing more.
If no annotation matches the specified parameter, the property will be ignored.
For instance, if the annotation `Retry` is specified on the class level for the class `com.acme.ClassA`, which has method methodB, the config property `com.acme.ClassA/methodB/Retry/maxRetries` will be ignored.
In order to override the property, the config property `com.acme.ClassA/Retry/maxRetries` or `Retry/maxRetries` needs to be specified.

package come.acme.test;
public class MyClient{
    /**
     * The configured the max retries is 90 but the max duration is 1000ms.
     * Once the duration is reached, no more retries should be performed,
     * even through it has not reached the max retries.
     */
    @Retry(maxRetries = 90, maxDuration= 1000)
    public void serviceB() {
        writingService();
    }

    /**
    * There should be 0-800ms (jitter is -400ms - 400ms) delays
    * between each invocation.
    * there should be at least 4 retries but no more than 10 retries.
    */
    @Retry(delay = 400, maxDuration= 3200, jitter= 400, maxRetries = 10)
    public Connection serviceA() {
        return connectionService();
    }

    /**
    * Sets retry condition, which means Retry will be performed on
    * IOException.
    */
    @Retry(retryOn = {IOException.class})
    public void serviceB() {
        writingService();
    }

}
----

If an annotation is not present, the configured properties are ignored.
For instance, the property `com.acme.ClassA/methodB/Retry/maxRetries` will be ignored if `@Retry` annotation is not specified on the `methodB` of `com.acme.ClassA`.
Similarly, the property `com.acme.ClassA/Retry/maxRetries` will be ignored if `@Retry` annotation is not specified on the class `com.acme.ClassA` as a class-level annotation.

=== Disabled Fault Tolerance policies with configuration

Fault Tolerance policies can be disabled with configuration at method level, class level or globally for all deployment.

Each policy can be disabled by using its annotation name.

* Disabling a policy at Method level

A policy can be disabled at method level with the following config property and value:

`<classname>/<methodname>/<annotation>/enabled=false`

For instance the following config will disable circuit breaker policy on `methodA` of `com.acme.test.MyClient` class:

`com.acme.test.MyClient/methodA/CircuitBreaker/enabled=false`

Policy will be disabled even if the policy is also defined at class level

* Disabling a policy at class level

A policy can be disabled at class level with the following config property and value:

`<classname>/<annotation>/enabled=false`

For instance the following config will disable fallback policy on `com.acme.test.MyClient` class:

`com.acme.test.MyClient/Fallback/enabled=false`

Policy will be disabled on all class methods even if a method has the policy.

* Disabling a policy globally

A policy can be disabled globally with the following config property and value:

`<annotation>/enabled=false`

For instance the following config will disable bulkhead policy globally:

`Bulkhead/enabled=false`

Policy will be disabled everywhere ignoring existing policy annotations on methods and classes.
